# Koshchei
A small game written with the `Jai` programming language.

## Language notice
Since `Jai` is not available to the general public GitHub does not recognize it. For that reason 
I've manually set the highlighting to `C`, which will make GitHub do some highlighting but it 
will likely be broken in many cases since `Jai` is a completely different language.

## Structure
- See: [docs/Time.md](./docs/Time.md) for estimated time spent working on this project.
- Configure the build metaprogram directly in: [./build/config.jai](./build_config.jai).

## Build
To build simply run:
```cmd
cd build && jai build.jai
```

To change build parameters such as verbosity or level of optimization edit `build_config.jai`
directly.
